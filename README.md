In Progress

This repo aim to be a computer algebra systems/do symbolic computation.
It is not intended to be optimized as i do not currently have the knowledge to do so.

In the symbolic computation folder there is a begning of documentation/how it works (Written with obsidian markdown editor so the .canvas is only readable in the editor)

# Inspiration
Here are the things that i took as inspiration to do this project.

Shunting_yard_algorithm : <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shunting_yard_algorithm>

Parser/Lexer : <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4m7ubrdbWQU&list=TLPQMTMwNjIwMjNugMfQwb6g1Q&index=4>

Math Engine : <https://www.numworks.com/>

Step of a CAS program : <https://www.pure.ed.ac.uk/ws/portalfiles/portal/413486/Solving_Symbolic_Equations_with_PRESS.pdf>

A CAS in JAVA (tutorial) : <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_VDz-fU4Ao&list=PLLQgf3TcCLzHH_nznjAF2bABWvQnYyLo-&index=1>

A CAS in C++ (symsengine) : <https://github.com/symengine/symengine/tree/master>

Theory on how to implement a CAS : <https://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/document?repid=rep1&type=pdf&doi=9f2d956ee98c3ad48bb460137e000df6a7343db9>

The codeBasee helped me understand how a lexer/perser works, Also maybe export a step by step solution using the pdf render : <https://github.com/typst/typst/tree/main>
